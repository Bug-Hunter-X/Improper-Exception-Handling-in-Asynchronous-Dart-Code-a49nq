# Improper Exception Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient exception handling within asynchronous functions.  The `fetchData` function attempts to fetch data from an API, but its error handling is inadequate for production environments.

## The Problem

The provided `bug.dart` file shows a `try-catch` block, which is a good start. However, it only prints the exception to the console.  This is insufficient for several reasons:

* **Lack of Specificity:**  The error message is generic.  A more informative message would provide details about the error, such as the API endpoint and the specific error code received.
* **Missing Logging:**  For production applications, logging to a file or service is crucial for tracking and debugging issues.
* **No Retry Mechanism:** The code doesn't attempt to retry the API call if there's a temporary network error.
* **No User Feedback:**  In a UI application, the user should be notified of the error in a user-friendly way.

## The Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version of the code. It includes:

* More detailed error logging.
* A user-friendly error message (in a hypothetical UI context).
* A simple retry mechanism.

This improved exception handling makes the code more robust and easier to debug.
